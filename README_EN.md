# boristane-workflow

Boris Tane workflow + minimal 3-variant ensemble (A/B/C) + reviewer fusion for complex tasks (>4 sub-steps). Auto-triggers when mentioning "boris".

## Inspiration

Systematic processing for complex software engineering tasks:
1. Task complexity assessment
2. Single solution design
3. Lack of quantitative review
4. Implementation-test disconnect

## Technical Features

### 1. Smart Task Classification
- Simple (≤4 sub-tasks): Direct execution
- Complex (>4 sub-tasks): Full multi-agent collaboration

### 2. Dynamic Agent Team
- Leader: Overall planning
- Reviewer: Quantitative reviews
- Executor: Implementation

### 3. Three-Variant Solutions
- Variant A: Minimal
- Variant B: Robust
- Variant C: Performance

### 4. Forced TDD
Write tests first, pass tests to complete

### 5. Quantitative Review
5 dimensions x 20 points: Code quality, Maintainability, Performance, Security, Scalability

## Usage Scenarios
- Complex feature development
- Code review & optimization
- Learning & research

Trigger: Mention "boris"
